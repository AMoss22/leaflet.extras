# leaflet.extras

The goal of leaflet.extras is to provide extra functionality to leaflet R package using various leaflet plugins.

For now you'll have to build leaflet from 
https://github.com/bhaskarvk/leaflet/tree/issue/283 to try this out. Check out the inst/examples for how to use the integrated pulse icon plugin
